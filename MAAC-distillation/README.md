 python main_KD.py

The code is an implementation of KnowRU based on MAAC, you should firstly install the MAAC. 
Before you begin to reuse knowledge, you should train some policy models firstly.

# MAAC:[*Actor-Attention-Critic for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02912) (Iqbal and Sha, ICML 2019)

## Requirements

* [OpenAI baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines), commit hash: 98257ef8c9bd23a24a330731ae54ed086d9ce4a7
* My [fork](https://github.com/shariqiqbal2810/multiagent-particle-envs) of Multi-agent Particle Environments
* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/), version: 0.3.0.post4
* [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym), version: 0.9.4
* [Tensorboard](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard), version: 0.4.0rc3 and [Tensorboard-Pytorch](https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboard-pytorch), version: 1.0 (for logging)

The versions are just what I used and not necessarily strict requirements.
